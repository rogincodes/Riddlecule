#### A website where you can answer countless riddles. Fun way to answer riddles, you will get an evil insult if you answered wrong, and a compliment if you get the answer right. I used API's to generate the riddles, evil insults, and compliments. Score is shown after quitting.
#### The website is only working for free, so it may take up to 50 seconds to load the first time, and also when first time submitting the answer.
